# 🔧 Frontend Deployment Fix

## ❌ **The Problem**
The frontend was showing "Error generating code" because:
1. Frontend code was hardcoded to use `http://localhost:5001`
2. Environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL` wasn't being used
3. CORS wasn't configured for your specific Vercel URLs

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Backend CORS** (already deployed)
- Added your specific Vercel URLs to allowed origins
- Made CORS more permissive for all Vercel domains

### 2. **Frontend API URLs** (being deployed now)
- Updated `useAIGenerator.js` to use `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- Updated `publishUtils.js` to use `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- Added proper environment variable handling

## 🎯 **What You Need to Do**

### **IMPORTANT: Set Environment Variables in Vercel**

1. Go to your **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Find your project: `ai-code-editor-generator`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://ai-code-editor-generator.onrender.com
REACT_APP_NETLIFY_API_TOKEN=nfp_5xwzHpYjg8SCMVEz6iebbTZkFUiR2EYZf935
```

5. **Redeploy** your frontend (it should auto-deploy from the latest push)

## 🔄 **Current Status**

✅ **Backend**: Updated and deployed with proper CORS  
🔄 **Frontend**: Code fixed, waiting for Vercel redeploy with environment variables

## 🧪 **After the Fix**

Once Vercel redeploys with the environment variables:
1. Your frontend will use the correct backend URL
2. CORS will allow the connection
3. AI generation should work perfectly
4. Publishing to Netlify should also work

## 🚨 **If It Still Doesn't Work**

Check the browser's **Developer Console** (F12) for any error messages and let me know what you see.

**The key issue was that your frontend was still trying to connect to localhost instead of your deployed backend!**
